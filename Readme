6. Clean Architecture (MVVM)

MVVM architecture with separation of concerns

Uses modern Android libraries:

Retrofit → API calls

Glide / Picasso → Image loading

Room → Local database

LiveData / StateFlow → Reactive data handling

7. UI/UX Design

Handles constraints (e.g., hiding profile images if restricted)

Intuitive and responsive layout

⚡ Getting Started
Prerequisites

🤔 Assumptions Made

Top Anime API is sufficient for initial listing

Offline caching is handled via Room

Trailers may not always be available, fallback to poster image

⚠️ Known Limitations

Limited error messages (basic handling only)

Offline sync may not handle all edge cases

UI is kept minimalistic (can be improved with Material3 / Compose)
